The [fragments](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/townley/elgin.html) in the Museé de Louvre are from the right of the frieze on the eastern side of the temple. One segment of the block depicts the point where a procession is coming to an end and the bodies of the two male and six female figures remain intact; however, only three female figures retain their head. This fragment is unlikely to ever be given back to Greece as the Louvre has proven to be unwilling to engage with conversations regarding the repatriation of the marbles in the past.

The [fragments](https://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/museo-gregoriano-profano/Marmi-del-Partenone.html) in the Vatican Museums include a head of a horse comes from the west frieze of the building and a fragment of a man holding a tray. These are a part of a larger piece of artwork that shows the struggle between Athena and Poseidon for patronage over Athens. The Vatican lended this fragment to the Acropolis Museum in [2008](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-vatican-marbles/vatican-lends-parthenon-marbles-fragment-to-greece-idUSTRE4A46A820081105).

The [fragments](https://artsandculture.google.com/streetview/cQHkijoR3eKSBg) from the National Museum in Copenhagen can be seen through the hyperlink to Google's streetview feature. The two heads housed in this museum tell the story of Lapith and the Centaur from the South Metope (the rest of this metope is housed in the British Museum). Both figures’ heads as well as a part of the Centaur’s leg were bought in Athens in 1688 by a Danish officer and remain in the museum. There have been little discussions about joining the metope with the other sculptures in the Acropolis Museum.

The [fragment](https://www.khm.at/en/objectdb/detail/50118/) from the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, Austria displays several fragments from the North Frieze which made their way into the museum’s collection by the Palazzo del Catajo in northern Italy. There have been discussions of loaning this fragments to the Acropolis Museum.
