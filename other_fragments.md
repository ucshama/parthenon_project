The parts of the frieze that are in the British Museum makes up around 80 meters of the total frieze. 50 remaining meters are in the Acropolis museum, and the remaining few fragments are scattered across the various museums you can see below through the software Peripleo.

The [fragment](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/townley/elgin.html) in the Muse√© de Louvre is from the right of the frieze on the eastern side of the temple. This segment of the block depicts the point where a procession is coming to an end and the bodies of the two male and six female figures remain intact; however, only three female figures retain their head. This fragment is unlikely to ever be given back to Greece as the Louvre has proven to be unwilling to engage with conversations regarding the repatriation of the marbles in the past.
