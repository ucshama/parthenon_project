| A+ | 97-100 |  | C+ | 76-79
| A | 93-96 |  | C | 73-76

## Attendance (10 points)

You will get 10 points for attending all twenty sections of the class. Special accommodations in case of absence due to medical reasons or other emergencies are possible. Contact the instructor in advance if you are going to miss a class.


## Participation (14 points)

Your participation in class discussions is a very important element for succeeding in this course. Effective participation includes:
- Doing the readings in advance and joining the discussion in class.
- Talking and contributing to the day’s topic by participating in class activities, raising new ideas, supporting an argument, offering a different perspective to an expressed view, or proposing an alternative tool, method or path for completing our tasks.
- Volunteering to present your weekly DH assignment.
Participation points are equally distributed among 15 sections of the class. This does not include the two “Final Presentations” sections. You will also get three “freebies,” that is three sections in which you can opt-out from participating without any impact on your participation grade.
If for any reason you cannot attend class, please notify me in advance. In cases where unforeseen circumstances (e.g., illness, family emergency) prohibit you from attending the class, you can make up the attendance and participation points for up to three absences by submitting an extra weekly response. 


## Weekly responses (16 points)
In every second meeting from Week 1 to Week 8, students are asked to submit a response worth 2 points. Your weekly responses are twofold:
### 1. Response paper (1.5 points)
You have to submit a response paper (max. 200 words) to one of the assigned articles. The paper is due before you arrive in class on the designated day. The aim of this assignment is for you to critically engaged with the assigned article. To do so effectively, make sure you are addressing:
1. What is the authors’ thesis? 
2. What types of evidence are they using? 
3. What are their conclusions?
4. What is your reaction to their work? Do you think that the authors are achieving their goal?

### 2. Critique of two digital tools/websites (0.5 point)
For this assignment you will have to choose two of the sites with which you have been asked to familiarize yourself. After you spend ~10 minutes on the website, grade it based on the following criteria:
- permanence and sustainability
- openness or restriction of their data
- functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
- connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
For each of the above four criteria, give a grade (A = Excellent; B = Fairly well; C = Inadequate) and provide a short sentence explaining why (e.g., “Openness: C. I cannot extract and download my query in any format”). More information about this task and an example will be provided in the class meeting.


## Weekly assignments (30 points)
In the first meeting of Week 2 to Week 7 (4 points x 6 weekly assignments), you will be assigned short projects and exercises. The aim of these assignments is to help you monitor how well you can navigate and use the different software and digital methods introduced in the class. The assignment is due before the beginning of the first meeting each week.
When doing digital humanities tasks, it is expected that software will fail and computers will crash. Working with technology can often be unpredictable, so it is important for all of us to plan well ahead in order to anticipate any technical issues. Make sure that you are able to install the necessary software and do not wait until the night before class to start your assignment. Notify your instructor in advance for any technical problem relevant to the assignment that you face. Feel free to email the instructor for any question related to the project. If you are failing to complete the task, your questions should show that you have already put significant effort to your assignment and you are not simply looking for the right answer. Depending on the nature of your assignment project, you will be asked to submit to me by email or upload it on GitHub.


## Final Project (35 points)
With the help of the instructor, students will define and implement a final project that makes use of one or more of the methods and digital tools that were examined in this class. The final project will be submitted in lieu of final exams and will be supported by a 1200-word paper. The project must demonstrate:
- a clear research question 
- competence of the student in one or more relevant software
- thoughtful incorporation of course content
- quality of the project design and appearance

Projects that overlap with a student’s field of study are particularly welcome. You can find a rubric on the class online repository that explains how your final project will be graded. Depending on the nature of your final project, you may submit to me by email or upload it on GitHub.
