## What is this course about?

Would you like to make and print a 3D copy of your favorite ancient object? Do you want to learn how to design a map of the ancient world? How about creating a Facebook for ancient people?

This class offers a hands-on introduction to the field of digital humanities with a special focus on ancient Greek and Roman antiquity. It is hard to provide a commonly accepted definition of Digital Humanities (DH). For the purpose of this class, however, we will define DH as a discipline that runs across the fields of humanities, whose scholars aim not only to study the different manifestations of human cultures and societies, but also to participate actively in using and developing computational tools that facilitate their work. 

With the goal of critically engaging with technology, not simply using it, we will combine reading discussions about DH approaches with weekly digital assignments in a variety of areas.  We will, for example, learn about the effective use of technology: to understand, describe, and interpret ancient society; to model and even recreate ancient objects and understand their significance in everyday life; and to visualize people’s social and economic behavior. The course includes weekly reading and digital humanities assignments and will conclude with a final research project.

## What you will learn
Upon completion of this class, you will be able to use, evaluate, and apply to the study of the ancient world a set of software and methods, such as: 
- creating or design a 3D model
- coding with Python and handling a series of filetypes
- creating and query a database
- publishing a text in html and xml format
- publishing a series of texts as a corpus
- analyzing geographical data and create maps
- creating and analyzing a social network

Thus, the students will be able to actively use modern technology in learning, understanding, and explaining the ancient world; to evaluate the plethora of new tools that become available on almost daily basis; and to set clear goals for their own projects in their professional lives.

While the digital tools and methods that are going to be presented will be exemplified by paradigms taken from the ancient world, the skills that the students will acquire are transferable to other fields of humanities.
