The West Frieze faced the entrance to the Acropolis, and shows the start of the Panathenaic procession. The general sense of direction is from right to left and the West Frieze is one of the most celebrated parts of the Parthenon frieze. It was left mostly intact after the explosion of the Parthenon by the Venetian attack and today it lays divided between the British Museum and the Acropolis Museum (as Lord Elgin took the first two blocks to England).


There is a marshall at the beginning and end of the frieze and between them are various carvings of horsemen and horses in different poses.
