Students with disabilities have the legal right to access disability-based support services designed to facilitate successful completion of their academic program. If this pertains to you, make sure to use any Resources available to students (more information [here](https://provost.uchicago.edu/handbook/clause/assistance-students-disabilities)), and I will gladly accommodate whatever is suggested by that office. Please be sure to talk to me at the beginning of the semester if you are going to make use of these services.
