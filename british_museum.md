The Parthenon Sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles, are fragments of the Parthenon Frieze that are currently housed in the Duveen Gallery of the British [Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum). When Greece was under Ottoman rule, Thomas Bruce, the 7th Earl of [Elgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bruce,_7th_Earl_of_Elgin) claimed that procured a mandate from a Turkish official to take pieces of the Parthenon. The reaction by the British public to the acquisition of the sculpture was varied but the sculptures remain in the British museum to this day.
