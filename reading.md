As the [university’s website states](https://college.uchicago.edu/student-services/academic-integrity-student-conduct), “each of us—students, faculty and staff—is pledged to live up to these standards and to support each others’ efforts in this regard.” Plagiarism constitutes a serious offense. Read more on the [Student Manual of University Policies & Regulations](https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/). Do not hesitate to contact me, if you have any residual questions of what constitutes plagiarism.
