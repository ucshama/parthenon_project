The [Acropolis Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_Museum) was founded in 2003. It opened to the public in 2009, and was constructed in part as a response by the Greek government to the British museum's claims that there was not an adequate place to display the Parthenon Sculptures. 

The museum is located in Athens at the foot of the Acropolis, located by the southeastern slope of the hill. It was built over Roman and early Byzantine ruins. Many Greek officials expressed hope that the completion of the museum would lead to the return of the Parthenon Sculptures but no such initiatives have taken place.
