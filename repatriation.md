The argument for repatriating the Parthenon Marbles or keeping them in the British Museum can be seen as an argument between [Cultural Internationalists and Cultural Nationalists](https://www.standrewslawreview.com/post/the-british-museum-and-the-elgin-marbles-the-repatriation-debate). Cultural Internationalists think cultural property should be experienced by everyone in the world and held in museums where they can be best accessed, researched and preserved. Cultural Nationalists believe that cultural property should stay within its country of origin and studied and understood in relation to the identity and personhood of its home.
